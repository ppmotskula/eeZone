eeZone is a simple tool for extracting useful information from the
.ee zone file.


INSTALLATION
============

Extract the contents of eeZone distribution archive into a directory of
your liking (henceforth referred to as $EEZONE).
Create a directory $EEZONE/data, and save a copy of the .ee zone file into
$EEZONE/data/eeZone.txt

Make sure you have bash, perl, sqlite3, host and whois installed and available
in your $PATH.

You'll want your computer to be connected to the internet whenever you use
eeZone.


USAGE
=====

Do-it-all-at-once:

    cd $EEZONE
    ./eeZone.sh -r -s

The script will probably take an hour or more to run. Once it's ready,
you'll find eeZone.db and a bunch of *sql and *txt files in $EEZONE/data.
Feel free to delete the *sql files if you want; they were only used to
create the eeZone.db SQLite3 database from which all the *txt files
except the original eeZone.txt were generated.

Run any script without any parameters to get information about other
command line options.

Read the code and occasional comments to understand how it all works.


BUGS AND IMPROVEMENTS
=====================

If you find a bug or have an idea for a new feature, feel free to fix
or implement it. You'll find the code from http://github.com/wolli/eeZone .
It'd be nice if you'd share your contributions with the original author who
might eventually include them in a new version of the program.

Should you have no time or skills to fix bugs or implement new features,
please report your findings at http://github.com/wolli/eeZone/issues .
